# Features Manager

This is the beginning of an app that I'll use to manage the definitions of "features galleries"
on my SmugMug site on [daveham.smugmug.com](https://daveham.smugmug.com/).

I started the app using my [reference starting configuration repo](https://github.com/daveham/MyTestApp).

This app will use the [SmugMug API](https://api.smugmug.com/api/v2/doc/index.html) to manipulate the galleries.

The app will also use the [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-js) for the DropBox API to store
and manage the metadata that defines the relationships between features galleries and full galleries.

Here is an example of a feature gallery and its corresponding full gallery from Palo Duro Canyon State Park:

[Rock Garden Trail Full gallery](https://daveham.smugmug.com/Nature/Texas/Rock-Garden-Trail)
